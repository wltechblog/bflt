# bflt

Brokedown's Flash Layout Tool

bflt is an easy to use option for creating flash images. This tool is still in development but the feaurtes that exist work.

# Building

You will need a Go compiler (https://go.dev/dl/) with gccgo (https://go.dev/doc/install/gccgo) and the dependencies of the Fyne toolkit (https://developer.fyne.io/started/#prerequisites)

Once those are met, installing/updating shoudl be a single command:

```
go install github.com/wltechblog/bflt@latest
```

Binary releases coming soon.
